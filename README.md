# My PHP Playground
A repository illustrating my tinkering and progress of learning [PHP](https://www.php.net/) because it is open source 
and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) uses it. Going to use online resources and a book most likely.

# Execution :gear:
At first I was surprised that nothing showed up after I opened the html file containing PHP. I learned that JavaScript is automatically served by the browser, not PHP. A server must be created to serve the PHP code.

"bUt I dOnT hAvE a SeRvEr!"

Not to worry, follow a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwQW0Qy85jY) to run the PHP on a website. Use open source [software](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) to serve your PHP code as highlighted in the tutorial. If you can't figure it out, I don't know what to tell you. You might have an amoeba for a brain or something.

Instead of searching for index.html, the server searches for index.php
